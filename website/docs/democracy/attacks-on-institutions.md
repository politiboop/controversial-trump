# Attacks on Democratic Institutions

Trump's systematic assault on American democratic norms, institutions, and the peaceful transfer of power represents an unprecedented threat in U.S. history.

## The "Big Lie" - 2020 Election Fraud Claims

Trump's false claims about the 2020 election represent the most dangerous assault on American democracy by a sitting president. Historians characterized it as implementation of Hitler's "big lie" propaganda technique:

- Filed 60+ lawsuits challenging election results; **61 of 62 failed in court**
- His own Attorney General William Barr: "The Department of Justice found no evidence of fraud"
- AP exhaustive investigation found **fewer than 475 potential fraud cases** out of 25+ million votes in six contested states—nowhere near enough to change any result
- Republican state officials, election officials, and judges all rejected fraud claims
- Republican Berkeley Research Group hired by Trump campaign found no fraud—reported to Trump before Jan 6
- Directly led to **January 6, 2021 Capitol attack** that killed 5 and injured 140+ police officers
- CREW found Trump spread 2020 election conspiracy theories **526 times** on Truth Social between Jan 2023-April 2024
- Courts ruled CNN's use of "big lie" to describe Trump's claims was accurate—not defamation (Nov 2025)
- Still repeats lie in 2025: Called 2020 "a fake election" and "a rigged election" at December 2025 Cabinet meeting

## Called for "Termination" of the Constitution (December 3, 2022)

After Elon Musk's "Twitter Files" release, Trump explicitly called for suspending the Constitution over his false election fraud claims:

- **Truth Social post:** "A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution"
- Suggested he should be **immediately reinstated as president** or hold a new election
- Even many Republicans condemned the statement—Mike Pence: "Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President"
- White House: "The American Constitution is a sacrosanct document... attacking it is anathema to the soul of our nation"
- Never retracted or apologized; instead claimed media "misrepresented" his words despite clear text
- Constitutional scholars called it **"the most anti-American statement ever made by a former president"**
- Represents explicit rejection of oath to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"
