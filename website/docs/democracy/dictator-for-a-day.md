# "Dictator for a Day" Statement (December 5, 2023)

During Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity, Trump refused to rule out acting as a dictator:

- **Hannity:** "You would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?"
- **Trump:** "Except for Day One"
- **Hannity (pressing):** "You're not going to be a dictator, are you?"
- **Trump:** "No, no, no, other than Day One. We're closing the border and we're drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I'm not a dictator"
- When given multiple opportunities to deny dictatorial ambitions, **repeatedly said "except for Day One"**
- Biden campaign: "Donald Trump has been telling us exactly what he will do if he's reelected and tonight he said he will be a dictator on day one"
- Democracy experts called it **"the clearest authoritarian threat ever made by an American presidential candidate"**
- Later doubled down at rallies, joking about the statement rather than clarifying
