Steve Bannon described the strategy: **"Flood the zone with shit"** [Source: Michael Lewis interview, 2018].

## "Alternative Facts" - Inauguration Crowd Size (January 21, 2017)

Trump's first official lie as president—and the birth of "alternative facts":

- Trump claimed "the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe"
- Aerial photos from Reuters clearly showed Obama's 2009 crowd was approximately **3x larger**
- Crowd expert estimate: Obama 2009 had **1.8 million**; Trump had **~200,000**

- Trump personally directed Spicer to make false claims (per Conway)

## "Sharpiegate" - Hurricane Dorian Map (September 2019)

Trump falsely claimed Alabama was in Hurricane Dorian's path, then doctored a government map to avoid admitting error:

- **September 1, 2019:** Tweeted Alabama would "most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated"
- National Weather Service Birmingham immediately corrected: "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts"
- Instead of correcting, Trump displayed official NOAA map in Oval Office **altered with black Sharpie** extending hurricane path to Alabama
- White House pressured federal weather experts behind the scenes to validate Trump's incorrect claim
- Boston Globe: Demonstrated his "authoritarian need to manipulate the truth"
- Dangerous: Could cause confusion about actual storm path, endanger lives
- #Sharpiegate trended worldwide with satirical memes

## Revolutionary War "Airports" (July 4, 2019)

During July 4th "Salute to America" speech at Lincoln Memorial, claimed Continental Army "took over the airports" in the 1770s:

- **"Our Army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do"**
- Also confused Revolutionary War with War of 1812, referencing Fort McHenry (1814) in same passage
- Wright Brothers' first flight: **1903**—over 125 years after Revolutionary War
- First commercial airport: College Park, Maryland, **1909**

## COVID-19 Disinformation (2020)

- **February 2020:** "It's going to disappear. One day—it's like a miracle—it will disappear"
- **April 23, 2020 press conference:** Suggested researching injection of disinfectant as COVID treatment
    - Exact quote: "And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning?"
    - Manufacturers including Lysol and Clorox issued emergency warnings not to ingest disinfectants
    - Next day claimed he was "being sarcastic"—video clearly shows he was addressing medical experts seriously
    - CNN: "Trump lied Friday when he said he was being 'sarcastic'"
- Also suggested bringing UV light "inside the body"
- Repeatedly promoted unproven hydroxychloroquine

## Second Term Lies (2025)

CNN fact-checked **100 false claims in Trump's first 100 days** of second term alone—and that was not comprehensive. Pattern continues unabated:

- Falsely claimed bacon prices **"quadrupled"** under Biden (actual increase: ~19-21%)

- Falsely claimed **"grocery prices are down"** (up 2.7% year-over-year per CPI)

- Claimed drug prices would be cut **"200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%"**—mathematically impossible (100% = free)

- Falsely claimed Washington DC has **"no murders"**—homicides continued throughout 2025
- Falsely claimed Ukraine **"started"** the war that Russia invaded
- Claimed Zelenskyy expressed **"zero gratitude"**—CNN compiled 78 examples of Zelenskyy thanking US

- **Joint address to Congress (March 2025):** Fact-checkers identified 12+ separate lies
- **UN speech (September 2025):** Spoke for 57 minutes (15-minute limit for all speakers), multiple false claims

## Other Notable First-Term Lies
