# Trump-Epstein Relationship & Files Controversy

## Long History with Jeffrey Epstein

- **2002 Trump quote to NY Magazine:** "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side"

- Denied knowing about Epstein's crimes despite 2002 comment about liking women "on the younger side"
- Claimed "I haven't spoken to him in 15 years"—but phone records show calls between them
