# Broken Promises & Failed Follow-Through

Trump repeatedly made grand promises he never delivered on, demonstrating a pattern of saying whatever was politically expedient without intention or ability to follow through.

## Second-Term Broken Promises (2025)

### "Lower Prices on Day One"

- Grocery prices continued rising; blamed "Biden's damage"
- Gas prices increased; blamed "global markets"

### "End Ukraine War in 24 Hours"

- **Promise:** "I'll have that war ended in 24 hours"

## Pattern of Empty Promises

- **"Coming in two weeks"** - Trump's go-to delay tactic for things that never materialize
- **"You'll see"** - Common response when pressed for specifics
- **"Bigger and better"** - Vague promise upgrades with no details
- **"Nobody knew [X] was so complicated"** - Admission after failing
- Makes promises based on what crowds want to hear, not feasibility
- Never takes responsibility for failures; always blames others
