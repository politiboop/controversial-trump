# Nuking Hurricanes

- **Multiple occasions (2017-2019):** Trump repeatedly suggested dropping nuclear bombs into hurricanes to disrupt them before they make landfall [Source: Axios, August 2019; confirmed by multiple officials]
- Reportedly asked senior Homeland Security and national security officials: **"Why don't we nuke them?"**
- NOAA had to publish explainer on why this would be catastrophic [Source: NOAA.gov]
- Would spread radioactive fallout, not actually stop the hurricane
- Officials said the briefing was interrupted by Trump asking about nukes so often they had to address it
