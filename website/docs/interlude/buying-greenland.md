# Buying Greenland

- **August 2019:** Seriously proposed that the **United States purchase Greenland** from Denmark
- When Denmark said Greenland wasn't for sale, Trump **canceled state visit** and called Danish PM's response "nasty" [Source: White House statements, August 2019]
- Greenland is an autonomous territory with its own government - not Denmark's to sell
- Greenland's premier: "We are not for sale" [Source: Official statement, August 2019]
