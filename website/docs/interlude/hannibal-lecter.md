# "The Late, Great Hannibal Lecter" (2024)

- Repeatedly praised **Hannibal Lecter** - the **fictional cannibal serial killer** from "Silence of the Lambs"
- **"The late, great Hannibal Lecter... he's a wonderful man"** [Source: Multiple rally speeches, 2024; Axios, Washington Post]
- Hannibal Lecter is not a real person and didn't die (because he never existed)
- Used this as part of immigration discussion somehow
