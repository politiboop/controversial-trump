Historian Douglas Brinkley: \"No president has ever been a 'serial liar' like Trump\" [Source: CNN interview, 2020]. The Post created a new category, the **\"Bottomless Pinocchio,\"** for falsehoods repeated 20+ times—Trump was the only politician to qualify, with 14 statements [Source: Washington Post, December 2018]. Steve Bannon described the strategy: **\"Flood the zone with shit\"** [Source: Michael Lewis interview, 2018].
