  "summary": "HHS Secretary Kennedy called California's folic acid fortification efforts 'insanity' and claimed 'California is waging war against her children.' MAHA influencers called folic acid a 'toxin.' California became first state requiring folic acid in corn masa flour for tortillas to prevent neural tube birth defects in Latino children. Since federal folic acid fortification began in 1998, birth defects dropped 40% for most groups but remained high for Latinas. Hispanic women have highest rate of spina bifida births. Medical experts support fortification as life-saving public health measure.",
