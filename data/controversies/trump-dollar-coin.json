  "summary": "Treasury Department planning to mint $1 coin with Trump's face on both sides for 2026 rollout, commemorating America's 250th anniversary (Semiquincentennial). US Mint released three proposed designs featuring Trump with 'LIBERTY,' 'IN GOD WE TRUST,' '1776 ~ 2026.' Breaks century-old precedent - living people banned from paper currency since 1866, strong tradition against living people on coins. Only second time living president on US coin (first: Coolidge in 1926). Federal Reserve: 'To avoid appearance of monarchy, long-standing tradition to only feature deceased individuals.' Sens. Merkley and Cortez Masto introduced 'Change Corruption Act' to block it.",
