  "primaryCategory": "ice-enforcement",
  "severity": "catastrophic",
  "timeline": "second-term",
  "date": "2026-01-25",
  "summary": "After fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol, AG Pam Bondi sent letter to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz with three demands before considering ICE withdrawal: hand over state voter rolls for 'compliance review,' provide welfare/Medicaid records for entire state, and repeal all sanctuary policies. Critics call it illegal extortion - conditioning federal law enforcement operations on unrelated policy changes and access to sensitive voter data. Experts say DOJ has no authority to demand state voter rolls or dictate state sanctuary policies. Appears to be attempt to 'take over elections in swing states.'",
