  "summary": "Trump administration promoted two separate plans to send checks to American citizens that never materialized. In February 2025, investor James Fishback proposed $5,000 'DOGE Dividend' checks to 80 million taxpaying households, with Trump saying his administration was considering sending 20% of DOGE savings to citizens. In November 2025, Trump promised '$2,000 a person' tariff dividend checks on Truth Social, claiming tariffs were generating enough revenue. Neither plan materialized. By the time Musk left DOGE in May 2025, promised savings hadn't materialized. Republican senators shot down tariff checks as 'insane,' wanting revenue to pay down debt instead. No checks were ever approved or sent despite repeated public promises.",
