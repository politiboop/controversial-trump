  "summary": "Trump has taken multiple contradictory positions on abortion and denies previous statements regularly. Claimed credit for overturning Roe v. Wade, then denied supporting bans. Said women should be 'punished' for abortion (2016), denied saying it hours later. Called himself 'strongly pro-life,' then claimed he's 'not going to do a federal ban.' Praised state bans, then criticized them. Takes every position then denies taking any position.",
