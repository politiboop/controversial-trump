Describes event as 'peaceful protest turned tragedy.' Claims 'Deep State entrapment, media deception' were responsible. Calls attendees 'patriotic Americans' and 'peaceful protesters.' Characterizes prosecutions as 'political targeting.' Alleges Democrats orchestrated 'the real insurrection.' This represents official government historical revisionism - contradicts documented evidence: 5 people died, 140+ police officers injured, over 1,500 charged, Proud Boys/Oath Keepers convicted of seditious conspiracy.",
