  "summary": "Interior Department unveiled 2026 America the Beautiful pass featuring Trump's face alongside George Washington instead of usual nature photo. Federal law requires main pass to feature winning photo from National Park Foundation annual photo contest (Glacier National Park for 2026). Center for Biological Diversity filed lawsuit to prevent Trump from 'replacing a beautiful picture of Glacier National Park with a closeup of his own face.' Sparked sticker protests - visitors covered Trump's face with stickers. NPS updated policy: passes 'may no longer be valid' if 'defaced or altered.' Visitors found workaround using card sleeves.",
