## Part I: Threats to Democracy & Rule of Law

### Attacks on Democratic Institutions

Trump's systematic assault on American democratic norms, institutions, and the peaceful transfer of power represents an unprecedented threat in U.S. history.

#### The "Big Lie" - 2020 Election Fraud Claims

Trump's false claims about the 2020 election represent the most dangerous assault on American democracy by a sitting president. Historians characterized it as implementation of Hitler's "big lie" propaganda technique:

- Filed 60+ lawsuits challenging election results; **61 of 62 failed in court**
- His own Attorney General William Barr: "The Department of Justice found no evidence of fraud"
- AP exhaustive investigation found **fewer than 475 potential fraud cases** out of 25+ million votes in six contested states—nowhere near enough to change any result
- Republican state officials, election officials, and judges all rejected fraud claims
- Republican Berkeley Research Group hired by Trump campaign found no fraud—reported to Trump before Jan 6
- Directly led to **January 6, 2021 Capitol attack** that killed 5 and injured 140+ police officers
- CREW found Trump spread 2020 election conspiracy theories **526 times** on Truth Social between Jan 2023-April 2024
- Courts ruled CNN's use of "big lie" to describe Trump's claims was accurate—not defamation (Nov 2025)
- Still repeats lie in 2025: Called 2020 "a fake election" and "a rigged election" at December 2025 Cabinet meeting

#### January 6 Capitol Attack

#### Called for "Termination" of the Constitution (December 3, 2022)

After Elon Musk's "Twitter Files" release, Trump explicitly called for suspending the Constitution over his false election fraud claims:

- **Truth Social post:** "A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution"
- Suggested he should be **immediately reinstated as president** or hold a new election
- Even many Republicans condemned the statement—Mike Pence: "Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President"
- White House: "The American Constitution is a sacrosanct document... attacking it is anathema to the soul of our nation"
- Never retracted or apologized; instead claimed media "misrepresented" his words despite clear text
- Constitutional scholars called it **"the most anti-American statement ever made by a former president"**
- Represents explicit rejection of oath to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"

### "Dictator for a Day" Statement (December 5, 2023)

During Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity, Trump refused to rule out acting as a dictator:

- **Hannity:** "You would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?"
- **Trump:** "Except for Day One"
- **Hannity (pressing):** "You're not going to be a dictator, are you?"
- **Trump:** "No, no, no, other than Day One. We're closing the border and we're drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I'm not a dictator"
- When given multiple opportunities to deny dictatorial ambitions, **repeatedly said "except for Day One"**
- Biden campaign: "Donald Trump has been telling us exactly what he will do if he's reelected and tonight he said he will be a dictator on day one"
- Democracy experts called it **"the clearest authoritarian threat ever made by an American presidential candidate"**
- Later doubled down at rallies, joking about the statement rather than clarifying

- **Opinion:** Former officials called it **"the biggest threat to democracy"** in Trump's plans [Source: Former OPM officials quoted in Washington Post]

#### "Alternative Facts" - Inauguration Crowd Size (January 21, 2017)

Trump's first official lie as president—and the birth of "alternative facts":

### "Sharpiegate" - Hurricane Dorian Map (September 2019)

Trump falsely claimed Alabama was in Hurricane Dorian's path, then doctored a government map to avoid admitting error:

    - Exact quote: "And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning?"
    - Manufacturers including Lysol and Clorox issued emergency warnings not to ingest disinfectants

### Second Term Lies (2025)
